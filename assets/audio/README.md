# Audio Assets

This folder contains placeholder audio files for the MathAdventure game.

## Required Audio Files:
- `correct.ogg` - Sound for correct answers
- `wrong.ogg` - Sound for wrong answers  
- `timeout.ogg` - Sound for timeout events

## Notes:
- Audio files should be in OGG format for best compatibility with Godot
- Keep audio files short (1-2 seconds) for responsive feedback
- Consider using different pitches or tones to distinguish between sounds

## Placeholder Implementation:
Currently, the game references audio nodes but no actual audio files are loaded. 
The AudioStreamPlayer nodes are set up and ready for audio files to be added.
